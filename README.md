# ECSpress

input data dimension: fluorescence(time,color,x,y)
Microscopy : 
Objective :


## Motion Correction and capillary elimination

## Single penetrating vessel analysis
Step
1. Detect penetrating vessels at c (PVs)
2. Calculate the average fluorescence of the outer boundary of a PV, save distance from PV (initial: 0)
3. Expand the outer boundary by one pixel (distance: +1) and do same thing of step 2
4. Repeat 3 until 

## Multiple penetrating vessels
